## Posts

When adding a new Post, make sure to copy the Example so you have all the right data you need, make sure to follow that structure and look at other posts if you need more inspiration.

The current **Categories** and **Subcategories** for Posts are as follows (both are required!):
- Games
	- Released
	- Prototype
	- Unreleased
- Tools
	- Plugins
	- Utilities
- Technical
	- Deepdive
- Devlog
*More categories may be added just make sure they don't go too specific, I'd rather have more Tags than Categories*

The current Tags for Posts are as follows (in this exact order):
- Unity
- Unreal
- Csharp
- Cpp
- VR
- Tools
- Solo
- Team
There's also hidden tags that are not shown and only used for filtering:
